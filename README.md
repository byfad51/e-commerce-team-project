# E-Commerce Team Project

Our project is an e-commerce application developed for the web platform. Although it has its shortcomings, we believe that it contains most of the things an e-commerce website should have.

This project started for the COMP202 (Software Engineering) and COMP204 (Database) courses and ended with the project presentation and project reports. Created by a team of 5 people in about 3 months.

Our project consists of main sections such as products, cart, home page, product detail, profile, admin.

What I did:
Although I mostly looked at the frontend, I also looked at the backend a little bit. For the frontend side, I have labor in most parts, except for the admin part.
